<div class="center-align" >
UI, UX, client-side logic, server-side routing, validation, error-handling, security, database interaction. VTML takes all these headaches and give you a simple declarative way to define the behaviour of a web page by interpreting your HTML. Say goodbye to diving through multiple programming languages to figure our how or why the pages works and say hello to a simple new kind of development.

<h3>VTML is...</h3>
<v-nodejs target=$adjectives >
    return ["fast", "easy", "awesome"]
</v-nodejs>

<ul>
    <v-for-each $adjectives as=$adj >
        <li>$adj</li>
    </v-for-each>
</ul>
