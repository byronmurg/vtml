			<!--
				Let's start with a create form.

				The user can add new todo text then click the submit button or hit enter.

				To make VTML handle the form all we need is a unique v-name attribute, in
				this case we use "create_todo".
			-->
			<form v-name="create_todo" >
				<!-- Here we define our for fields. This is just normal HTML -->
				<fieldset role="group" >
					<input name="text" type="text" autofocus="yes" maxlength="128" required />
					<button type="submit" class="material-icons" >add</button>
				</fieldset>

				<!--
					Any 'v-' tag that ends with '-action' will be called when the form submits
					
					In this case we insert to the text from the form body into table with sql.

					Note that we can refer to the new text as $.body.text because the input
					above has name="text"
				-->
				<v-sql-action>
					INSERT INTO simple.todos (text) VALUES ($.body.text)
				</v-sql-action>

				<!-- And that's it! All we have to do. -->
			</form>

			<hr/>

			<!--
				Now let's get the todos already in the database and show them to the client.

				We start with a v-sql block which selects all todos and sets them to the
				vtml variable 'todos'. Later we'll be able to reference this variable
				with '$todos'.
			-->
			<v-sql target="todos" >
				SELECT * FROM simple.todos ORDER BY c DESC
			</v-sql>

			<!--
				So the sql we just ran returned multiple rows and we want each row to be
				rendered as it's own entry.

				To do this we use v-for-each and specify the $todos variable to loop through.
			-->
			<v-for-each source="$todos" >

				<!--
					We're now inside the loop and can taking in individual rows.

					We could do something like <p>$text</p> to display the text of each todo.
					
					Instead we're going display the entries as forms so that they can be
					updated.
				-->

				<form v-name="edit_todo" >
					<!--
						Here we have a form to edit the text of the todos.

						Just like before we have the html to be displayed then the sql to
						be executed when the form is submitted.

						But this time we set the value of the inputs from the data in the row.

						See how the input below has value="$text". That will template the
						current value into the text input.

						Also note how we add a hidden input with value="$_id". This is because
						when we submit the form vtml doesn't know *which* todo we want to
						submit it for, so we need to specify the id.
					-->

					<input name="text" value="$text" maxlength="128" />
					<input type="hidden" name="id" value="$_id" />

					<v-sql-action>
						UPDATE simple.todos SET text = $body.text WHERE _id = $.body.id
					</v-sql-action>

				</form>

				<form v-name="delete_todo" >
					<!--
						Let's add a button to delete the todo.

						This is largely the same as the last form but this time we don't
						need a text input.
					-->

					<input type="hidden" name="id" value="$_id" />
					<button type="submit" class="material-icons" >delete</button>

					<v-sql-action>
						DELETE FROM simple.todos WHERE _id = $.body.id
					</v-sql-action>
				</form>

			</v-for-each>

			<!--
				To finish let's add something a bit different.

				After the main list I want to put the total number of todos on the page.

				But we don't have a tag for that so we must write it in javascript that 
				executes on the server.
			-->

			<!--
				So here we have a v-nodejs block that returns the length of the todos array
				and sets it to the 'ntodos' variable.
			-->
			<v-nodejs target="ntodos" >
				return $todos.length
			</v-nodejs>

			<!-- Now we can use $ntodos in a <p> tag -->
			<p>There are $ntodos todos</p>
